**GD0201 – The name of the delegate must end with `EventHandler`**

> **Rule ID**: `GD0201`  
> **Category**: Usage  
> **Fix**: Breaking  
> **Enabled by default**: Yes

### 1. Overview

This rule applies to C# delegates in Godot that are marked with the `[Signal]` attribute.  
Godot’s signal convention requires that such delegates end with the suffix **`EventHandler`** to keep the API consistent and to avoid confusion with other delegate types.

---

### 2. Cause

> A delegate annotated with the `[Signal]` attribute has a name that **does not** end with `EventHandler`.

Typical misuse:

```csharp
// ❌ This is not compliant
[Signal]
public delegate void PlayerHit(int damage);
```

The above example will trigger the diagnostic because the delegate name `PlayerHit` does not follow the convention.

---

### 3. How to fix

Rename the delegate so that its name ends with `EventHandler`.  
The rest of the code remains unchanged.

```csharp
// ✅ Compliant
[Signal]
public delegate void PlayerHitEventHandler(int damage);
```

If you prefer a more descriptive name, you can combine the action with a clear suffix:

```csharp
[Signal]
public delegate void OnPlayerHitEventHandler(int damage);
```

### 4. When this rule is applied

The compiler will emit a diagnostic whenever a signal delegate’s name fails to satisfy the rule.  
Since the rule is marked as **breaking**, a non‑compliant name will be considered an error in the code‑analysis pipeline.

* **GD0202** – The parameter of the delegate signature of the signal is not supported  
* **GD0210** – Signal delegate types should be `EventHandler` or `EventHandler<T>` (example: `PlayerHitEventHandler`)
