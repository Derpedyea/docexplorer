# GD0303 – “The parent symbol of a type argument that must be Variant compatible was not handled”

> This is a **diagnostic rule** that is part of Godot’s C# compiler checks.  
> The rule is enabled by default and is *not* fixable automatically; it indicates a bug in the engine that must be reported.

## Rule Metadata

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **ID** | `GD0303` |
| **Category** | `Usage` |
| **Fix** | Breaking or non‑breaking: *Not fixable* |
| **Enabled by default** | ✅ |

## Cause

This error is emitted when the compiler encounters a generic type argument whose *parent symbol* is required to be Variant‑compatible, but that parent has not been handled properly in the engine. In short, the engine is missing support for a particular generic scenario, and the code triggers a diagnostic.

## Rule Description

> The parent symbol of a type argument that must be Variant compatible was not handled.

If you see this diagnostic, it usually means you are using a generic type that the Godot runtime does not fully support in the current build. Because the rule is marked “not fixable”, the only remedy is to **file an issue** on the Godot project’s bug tracker. In the meantime, avoid using the specific generic pattern or work around it with a different API.

> **Note:** This is not a user‑code error; it is a bug in the engine. Do not try to modify your code to suppress it – report it instead.

## How to Report

1. Open the [Godot issue tracker](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues).
2. Search to see if the issue already exists.
3. If not, create a new issue with:
   * The full stack trace or code snippet that produced the error.
   * The Godot version and build you’re using.
   * A minimal reproducible example if possible.
