**GD0106 – The exported property is an explicit interface implementation**

This rule is part of the Godot C# diagnostics system.  
It warns when an explicit interface property implementation is marked with the `Export` attribute (or a similar attribute that makes the property visible in the editor), which can cause runtime errors and unexpected behaviour.

## Cause

An explicit interface implementation is annotated with the `Export` attribute (or another attribute that exposes the property to the Godot editor).  
Because explicit interface implementations are not part of the class’s public API, exporting them is unsupported and will be ignored by the editor.

```csharp
public interface IMyInterface
{
    int Value { get; set; }
}

public class MyClass : Node, IMyInterface
{
    [Export] // ❌ This is illegal
    int IMyInterface.Value
    {
        get => _value;
        set => _value = value;
    }
}
```

### Why it matters

* The property will **not** be visible in the Godot Inspector, so you cannot set it from the editor.
* At runtime the exported value will never be initialised, leading to default values and potentially bugs.
* The compiler may emit a warning or error, depending on the project’s diagnostic settings.

## Fix

Remove the `Export` (or other editor‑visible) attribute from the explicit interface implementation.  
If you need to expose a value that is part of an interface, expose a separate public property or use a helper method that forwards to the interface member.

```csharp
public class MyClass : Node, IMyInterface
{
    [Export] // This is now a normal public property
    public int Value { get; set; }

    // Implement the interface explicitly
    int IMyInterface.Value
    {
        get => Value;
        set => Value = value;
    }
}
```
