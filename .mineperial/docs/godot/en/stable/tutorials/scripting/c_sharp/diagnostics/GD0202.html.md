**GD0202: The parameter of the delegate signature of the signal is not supported**  

*This page is part of the Godot Engine documentation – a technical rule description for C# diagnostics.*

---

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Rule ID** | `GD0202` |
| **Category** | Usage |
| **Fix type** | Breaking if the parameter type is changed; Non‑breaking if the `[Signal]` attribute is removed |
| **Enabled by default** | Yes |

---

## What the rule checks

When you declare a **C# signal** in Godot you use the `[Signal]` attribute and a delegate type that matches Godot’s signal signature convention.  
`GD0202` is triggered when the *parameter* of that delegate signature uses a type that Godot does **not** support for signals.  
Typical unsupported types include:

- Any custom classes that are not `GodotObject` derivatives
- Types that are not exposed to the Godot type system (e.g., `List<>`, `Dictionary<>`, etc.)

---

## Why this matters

Signals are a core feature of Godot’s event‑driven architecture.  
Using a non‑supported parameter type will cause the editor or runtime to throw an exception and the signal to be unusable.

---

## Fixes

| Fix | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Change the parameter type** | Replace the unsupported type with a supported one (e.g., `int`, `float`, `String`, `Node`, `Object`, etc.). |
| **Remove the `[Signal]` attribute** | If the signal is not needed, simply delete the attribute so the method is treated as a regular method. |

> **Breaking** – changing the parameter type changes the contract of the signal and may require updating all signal connections.  
> **Non‑breaking** – removing the `[Signal]` attribute eliminates the signal entirely, which is safe if no one relies on it.

## Example

```csharp
// ❌ This will trigger GD0202 because `List<int>` is unsupported.
[Signal] public delegate void MySignal(List<int> data);

// ✅ Supported: use a built‑in type or a GodotObject.
[Signal] public delegate void MySignal(int data);
```
