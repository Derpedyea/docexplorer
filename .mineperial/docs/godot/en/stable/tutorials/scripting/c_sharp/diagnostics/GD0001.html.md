**GD0001 – Missing partial modifier on declaration of type that derives from GodotObject**

> A C# class that inherits from a Godot type (e.g. `Node`, `Control`, `GodotObject`, …) must be declared as `partial`.  
> The Godot build pipeline generates additional partial source files that extend your class; if the `partial` modifier is missing the generated code cannot be merged, resulting in runtime failures.

## Description

The Godot C# compiler generates a companion file for every script that inherits from a Godot class. That generated file is a **partial** class that contains exported property bindings, signal wrappers, etc.  
If your script does **not** declare its class as `partial`, the compiler cannot merge the generated code and the script will compile but will not expose exported properties, signals, or any of the Godot‑specific plumbing.

---

## Cause

You declared a class that inherits from a Godot type **without** the `partial` keyword.

```csharp
// ❌ Problematic
public class Player : Node2D
{
    // …
}
```

---

## Fix

Add the `partial` keyword to the class declaration.

```csharp
// ✅ Correct
public partial class Player : Node2D
{
    // …
}
```

> **Note:** If you intentionally want to keep the class non‑partial (e.g., you are not using any exported properties or signals), you can suppress the warning with the `#pragma warning disable GD0001` directive, but it is recommended to keep the class partial to fully support Godot’s code generation features.

---

## Quick‑start checklist

1. **Open** the script file in the Godot editor or your IDE.
2. **Locate** the class declaration line.
3. **Add** `partial` after the access modifier (or before `class` if no access modifier).
4. **Save** the file and let the editor re‑compile.
5. **Run** the scene – the warning should no longer appear.
