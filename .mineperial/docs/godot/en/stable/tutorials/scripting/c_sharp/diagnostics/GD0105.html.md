# GD0105 – “The exported property is an indexer”

**Rule ID** | **GD0105**  
--- | ---  
**Category** | Usage  
**Fix type** | Non‑breaking  
**Enabled by default** | ✅ Yes

## What the rule checks

In C# you can expose class members to Godot’s editor by annotating them with the `[Export]` attribute.  
This rule is triggered when a **property indexer** is marked with `[Export]`.  
Indexers in C# (`this[int index]`) do not map to a single value that can be edited in the inspector, so they cannot be exported.

---

## Why it’s a problem

* Indexers are not represented as a single field in the Godot editor.  
* Exporting them would create confusion for designers who expect a regular exported property.  
* The compiler may silently ignore the attribute or produce a warning, which can hide bugs.

---

## Typical code that violates the rule

```csharp
public class Inventory : Node
{
    [Export]                     // ❌ This will raise GD0105
    public int this[int index]
    {
        get => _items[index];
        set => _items[index] = value;
    }
}
```

---

## Fixing the issue

* **Remove the `[Export]` attribute** from the indexer, or  
* If you want to expose a collection of values, expose the underlying list/array instead.

```csharp
public class Inventory : Node
{
    // Export the array directly
    [Export] public int[] Items { get; set; }

    // Indexer without export
    public int this[int index]
    {
        get => Items[index];
        set => Items[index] = value;
    }
}
```

## When this rule fires

The diagnostic appears when the compiler processes a property that matches the indexer pattern (`this[...])` and is annotated with `[Export]`.  
The error message will look something like:

```
GD0105: The exported property is an indexer. Indexers cannot be exported.
```
