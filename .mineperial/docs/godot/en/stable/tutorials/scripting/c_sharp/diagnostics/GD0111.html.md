**GD0111: The exported tool button must be an expression‑bodied property**

> This rule is part of the Godot C# diagnostic suite. It warns when a property that is decorated with the `[ExportToolButton]` attribute is *not* written as an expression‑bodied property.

## Rule overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Rule ID** | `GD0111` |
| **Category** | Usage |
| **Fix type** | Non‑breaking |
| **Enabled by default** | ✅ |

## Why this rule matters

`[ExportToolButton]` is used in the Godot editor to expose a **tool‑button** for a property. For consistency and to avoid accidental misuse, the property must be implemented as an **expression‑bodied property** – that is, a single expression that returns a value, rather than a block that contains a getter/setter.

---

## Example of a violation

```csharp
// ❌ Violation: not expression‑bodied
[ExportToolButton]
public bool MyButton
{
    get { return _myButton; }
    set { _myButton = value; }
}
```

---

## Correct way

```csharp
// ✅ Fix: expression‑bodied property
[ExportToolButton]
public bool MyButton => _myButton;
```

---

## How to fix

* Convert the property into an expression‑bodied form, or
* Remove the `[ExportToolButton]` attribute if it’s not needed.
