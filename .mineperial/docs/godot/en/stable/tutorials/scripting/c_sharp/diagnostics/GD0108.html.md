# GD0108 – “The exported tool button is not in a tool class”

This rule is part of the **Godot C# diagnostics**.  
It checks that any property annotated with the `ExportToolButton` attribute is
declared inside a *tool* class (a class that can run in the editor).

> **Fix**: Non‑breaking  
> **Enabled by default**: Yes

## Description

`ExportToolButton` is a special export attribute that creates a button in the
editor’s inspector for a given property.  
Because the button’s logic is executed by the editor, it can only work if the
containing class is marked as a **tool**.  
If the attribute is used in a regular (non‑tool) class, the button will not
appear and the script will not compile correctly when running in the editor.

---

## Cause

A property is annotated with the `[ExportToolButton]` attribute inside a
class that is **not** declared as a tool.  
Example:

```csharp
public class MyScript : Node
{
    [ExportToolButton]
    public string DoSomething { get; set; }
}
```

In this case, `MyScript` is not a tool class, so the editor cannot
create the button.

---

## Fix

Declare the class (or the script file) as a *tool* class.

```csharp
[Tool]                     // <-- add this attribute
public class MyScript : Node
{
    [ExportToolButton]
    public string DoSomething { get; set; }
}
```

Alternatively, move the property to a class that already inherits from a
tool‑enabled class.

## Example

**Before (error)**

```csharp
using Godot;

public class Example : Node
{
    [ExportToolButton]   // ❌ Not a tool class
    public int ResetValue { get; set; }
}
```

**After (fixed)**

```csharp
using Godot;

[Tool]                     // ✅ Tool class
public class Example : Node
{
    [ExportToolButton]   // ✔️ Now works
    public int ResetValue { get; set; }
}
```
