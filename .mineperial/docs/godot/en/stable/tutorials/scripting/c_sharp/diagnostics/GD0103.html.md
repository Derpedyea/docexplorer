# GD0103: The exported member is read‑only  

This diagnostic rule belongs to the *C# Analyzer* in Godot.  
It warns when a member that can’t be written to (i.e. a **read‑only field** or a **property without a setter**) is marked with the `[Export]` attribute.

| **Rule ID** | GD0103 |
|------------|--------|
| **Category** | Usage |
| **Fix type** | Non‑breaking |
| **Enabled by default** | ✅ |

## Description

Godot’s inspector can only modify exported values that are *readable* **and** *writeable*.  
Exporting a read‑only member is unnecessary and can lead to confusion because the value cannot be changed from the editor. This rule catches that situation.

## Cause

A read‑only member (e.g. a field declared `readonly` or a property that only exposes a getter) is annotated with `[Export]`.

```csharp
public class MyNode : Node2D
{
    // ❌ GD0103 – exported read‑only property
    [Export]
    public int Score { get; } = 0;
}
```

## Fix

* **Remove the `[Export]` attribute** if the value is not meant to be exposed to the editor.
* **Make the member mutable** – either use a plain field or add a setter to the property.

```csharp
public class MyNode : Node2D
{
    // ✅ exported field
    [Export]
    public int Score;

    // or
    // ✅ exported property with a setter
    [Export]
    public int Score { get; set; } = 0;
}
```
