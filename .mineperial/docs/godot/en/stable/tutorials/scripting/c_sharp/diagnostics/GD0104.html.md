**GD0104 – The exported property is write‑only**  
==============================================

> *A write‑only property cannot be edited from the Godot editor because the exported value has no getter. This rule warns you about such cases.*

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Rule ID** | `GD0104` |
| **Category** | Usage |
| **Severity** | Non‑breaking (the engine will still run) |
| **Enabled by default** | ✅ |

## What the rule checks

The linter scans your C# scripts for fields or properties that are:

1. **Marked with the `[Export]` attribute** – making them visible in the inspector, or
2. **Write‑only** – i.e. the property only declares a `set` accessor but no `get`.

Because the editor can’t read a value that has no getter, the field will **not appear in the inspector** and cannot be edited from there. This usually indicates a logic error or an accidental omission.

> ⚠️ The editor will ignore the property completely, but the compiled code will still work. Still, it is best to make the property read‑write or add a getter.

## Example

```csharp
// ❌ This will trigger GD0104
[Export]
public int Health { set { _health = value; } }

// ✅ Make it read‑write
[Export]
public int Health
{
    get => _health;
    set => _health = value;
}

// ✅ Or expose the backing field instead
[Export] private int _health;
```

## How to fix

| Approach | When to use | How |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **Add a getter** | The property should be editable from the editor. | Implement `get` returning the underlying value. |
| **Expose the backing field** | You only need a write‑only value in code, but want it visible. | Make the field itself `[Export]` and expose it publicly. |
| **Remove `[Export]`** | The value should never be edited from the inspector. | Simply drop the attribute; the property will stay write‑only in code. |

## Related rules

- **GD0103 – The exported member is read‑only** – opposite case, a property with only a getter.
- **GD0105 – The exported property is an indexer** – detects indexer usage that is not supported by the editor.

If you’re unsure whether a property should be read‑write, think about whether you want to tweak its value in the editor or need the value in code. Keeping exported properties read‑write generally provides better flexibility for designers and easier debugging.
