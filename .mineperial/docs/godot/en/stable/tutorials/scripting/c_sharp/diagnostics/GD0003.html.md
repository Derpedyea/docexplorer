## What it means

When the C# compiler processes a script file it expects each **public** type that derives from `GodotObject` to have a unique name within that file.  
If you declare two (or more) classes, structs, or interfaces with the same name in a single script file, the compiler emits this warning.

Typical causes:

- Accidentally defining a second class with the same name in the same file.
- Copy‑paste errors that duplicate a type definition.
- Mixing partial classes incorrectly.

Because the runtime can’t distinguish between the two definitions, the editor will refuse to load the script or will load the wrong type.

## Example

```csharp
using Godot;

// ❌ This file contains two classes named `Player`
public partial class Player : Node
{
    // …
}

public partial class Player : Node
{
    // …
}
```

**Fix**  
Rename one of the classes or move each definition to its own file:

```csharp
// Player.gd.cs
public partial class Player : Node
{
    // …
}

// Enemy.gd.cs
public partial class Enemy : Node
{
    // …
}
```

## How to avoid it

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Defining multiple types in one file | Use one file per public type, or use the `partial` keyword only when the definition is split intentionally across files. |
| Using `partial` classes | Ensure the file names and class names are consistent and unique. |
| Copy‑pasting code blocks | Always search for duplicate names before re‑using the code. |
