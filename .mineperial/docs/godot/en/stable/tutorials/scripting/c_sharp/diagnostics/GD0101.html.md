# GD0101 – The exported member is static

The **GD0101** rule warns when a member that has been marked with the
`[Export]` attribute is declared `static`.  
Static members cannot be edited through the editor inspector or be saved
in the scene, which defeats the purpose of exporting them.

> **Rule ID**: `GD0101`  
> **Category**: `Usage`  
> **Severity**: *Warn*  
> **Enabled by default**: ✅

## What this means

When you write something like:

```csharp
[Export] public static int Speed = 10;
```

the Godot editor will still show the `Speed` property in the inspector,
but because the field is **static** it belongs to the class rather than to
the instance of the node. Therefore:

* The value cannot be persisted per‑scene or per‑node.
* The inspector will display the property but changes will not be saved
  and will revert when the scene is re‑opened.
* In most cases you actually want a **normal instance field** so each
  node can have its own value.

## How to fix

You can resolve the warning in two ways:

1. **Remove the `static` keyword** (breaking change)  
   ```csharp
   [Export] public int Speed = 10;
   ```
   This makes the field an instance variable, which can be edited in the
   editor and serialized per‑node.

2. **Remove the `[Export]` attribute** (non‑breaking change)  
   ```csharp
   public static int Speed = 10;
   ```
   If you really need a static value, simply drop the export. Static
   variables are usually used for global configuration or constants.

> **Recommendation:** Prefer the first solution unless the value truly
> needs to be shared globally.

## Example

### Before (warning)

```csharp
public class Player : Node
{
    [Export] public static float jumpHeight = 5.0f;
}
```

### After (resolved)

```csharp
public class Player : Node
{
    [Export] public float jumpHeight = 5.0f;   // instance variable
}
```

or

```csharp
public class Player : Node
{
    public static float jumpHeight = 5.0f;      // no export
}
```
