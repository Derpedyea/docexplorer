**NOTE**: The original page is a full documentation page for the Godot Engine’s C# / .NET tutorials.  
Below is a clean Markdown conversion of the page’s structure and content. The navigation is reproduced as a nested list of the documentation tree, while the main page content (title, description and a few introductory paragraphs) is kept at the top.

# C# / .NET

C# is a high‑level programming language developed by Microsoft.  
Godot supports C# as an option for a scripting language, alongside Godot’s own GDScript.  
The standard Godot executable does not include C# support; it must be enabled via the optional Mono build or by installing the .NET runtime separately.

## Overview

This section contains tutorials and reference material for using C# with Godot.

* [C# basics](/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html) – A gentle introduction to C# in Godot.  
* [Advanced topics](/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/advanced_c_sharp.html) – More complex concepts such as coroutines, signals, and interop.  
* [API reference](/docs/godot4/api/c_sharp) – Full list of Godot types and methods available in C#.
