**GD0102 – The type of the exported member is not supported**  
*Godot Engine – Diagnostics – C#*

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Rule ID** | `GD0102` |
| **Category** | Usage |
| **Fix type** | Breaking if the member type is changed; Non‑breaking if the `[Export]` attribute is removed |
| **Enabled by default** | Yes |

---

### What does this rule check for?

In C#, you can expose a field or property to the Godot editor using the `[Export]` attribute.  
`GD0102` warns when the type you attempt to export is not supported by Godot’s serialization system.  
Supported types include the basic Godot types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `String`, `Vector2`, etc.) and many built‑in Godot resource types. Types that rely on runtime reflection or that cannot be serialized (e.g., `Action`, generic collections, pointers, delegates, or certain .NET types) will trigger this diagnostic.

---

### Why is it a problem?

- **Editor visibility**: The exported member will not appear in the Inspector, so you can’t tweak it in the editor.
- **Serialization failure**: When the scene or resource is saved, the unsupported value will be dropped or cause runtime errors.
- **Code quality**: It often indicates a design that doesn’t fit Godot’s node‑based workflow.

### How to fix it

| Option | What to do | Effect |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Change the member type** | Replace the unsupported type with a supported one (e.g., use `int` instead of `uint`, `Vector2I` instead of `Vector2`, or a Godot `Vector2` wrapper). | **Breaking** – the member type changes, so existing values may need conversion. |
| **Remove the `[Export]` attribute** | If the value should not be exposed to the editor, simply delete the attribute. | **Non‑breaking** – the code runs unchanged, but the member is no longer editable in the Inspector. |
| **Implement a custom `GodotObject` that serializes the value** | For complex data that needs to be edited, create a resource or a `GodotObject` subclass that stores the value and expose that instead. | **Breaking** – you need to adjust any code that was accessing the old type. |

### Example

**Problematic code**

```csharp
using Godot;

public partial class MyNode : Node
{
    // ❌ Exporting a delegate is not supported
    [Export] public Action OnSomething;
}
```

**Fix**

```csharp
using Godot;

public partial class MyNode : Node
{
    // ✅ Use a signal instead of a delegate
    [Signal] public delegate void OnSomethingEventHandler();

    // or expose a supported type
    [Export] public string MyMessage;
}
```

---

### When will this appear?

The diagnostic is emitted during the **C# project build** and by the **Godot editor’s diagnostics panel**.  
It typically shows up as a warning/error in the output console with the message:

```
GD0102: The type of the exported member 'OnSomething' is not supported.
```
