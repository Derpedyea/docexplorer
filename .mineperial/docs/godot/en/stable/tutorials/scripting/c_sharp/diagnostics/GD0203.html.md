# GD0203: The delegate signature of the signal must return void

This rule is part of Godot’s diagnostics for C# scripts.  
It enforces that any delegate used as a **signal** must have a `void` return type.

## Rule Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Rule ID** | `GD0203` |
| **Category** | `Usage` |
| **Fix type** | *Breaking* – if you change the return type to `void`, or *Non‑breaking* – if you remove the `[Signal]` attribute |
| **Enabled by default** | ✅ Yes |

---

## What the rule checks

When you declare a signal in C#, the delegate signature must **return `void`**.  
For example:

```csharp
[Signal]
public delegate void PlayerScored(int score);
```

If you mistakenly declare a return type other than `void`, e.g.:

```csharp
[Signal]
public delegate int PlayerScored(int score);   // ❌ Invalid
```

the compiler will raise a diagnostic (GD0203).

## Why this matters

* Godot signals are event callbacks that **do not return a value** to the emitter.  
* A non‑`void` signature would imply a return value that the signal infrastructure cannot handle, leading to runtime errors or silent failures.

---

## How to fix

* **Change the return type to `void`.**  
  ```csharp
  [Signal]
  public delegate void PlayerScored(int score);
  ```

* **Or remove the `[Signal]` attribute** if the delegate is meant to be a regular method, not a signal.

## Example

### Incorrect

```csharp
public class Game : Node
{
    // This will trigger GD0203
    [Signal]
    public delegate int ScoreUpdated(int newScore);
}
```

### Correct

```csharp
public class Game : Node
{
    [Signal]
    public delegate void ScoreUpdated(int newScore);
}
```

## Related Rules

* **GD0202** – The parameter of the delegate signature of the signal is not supported.  
* **GD0301** – The generic type argument must be a Variant compatible type.
