**GD0302 – The generic type parameter must be annotated with the `[MustBeVariant]` attribute**  
*Godot Engine – Diagnostics – C#*

### Rule ID
`GD0302`

### Category
*Usage*

### Fix
Breaking – the code will not compile until the issue is resolved.

### Enabled by default
Yes

## Cause

When a Godot method (or API that ultimately goes to the engine) expects a **Variant‑compatible** type, a generic type parameter used as an argument must be marked with the `[MustBeVariant]` attribute.  
If the attribute is missing, the compiler can’t guarantee that the type can be safely converted to or from a `Variant`, so it emits this diagnostic.

Typical situation: a custom generic method or callback that forwards its arguments to a Godot API which accepts a `Variant`.

## Example

### Problematic code

```csharp
using Godot;

public class MyNode : Node
{
    // GD0302 is raised here: 'T' is not marked with [MustBeVariant]
    public void Forward<T>(T value)
    {
        // This call eventually passes the value to a Variant‑accepting API
        Call("some_method", value);
    }
}
```

### How to fix it

```csharp
using Godot;

public class MyNode : Node
{
    // Add [MustBeVariant] so the compiler knows T can be stored in a Variant
    public void Forward<[MustBeVariant] T>(T value)
    {
        Call("some_method", value);
    }
}
```

> **Tip**: If you only ever call the method with a concrete Variant‑compatible type (e.g., `int`, `string`, `Vector3`), you can also avoid generics altogether and use a non‑generic overload.
