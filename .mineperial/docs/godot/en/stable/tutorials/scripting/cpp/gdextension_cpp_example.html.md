**Getting started** – Godot Engine (stable) documentation

---

> *Workflow overview:* As a GDExtension, `godot-cpp` is more complicated to use than GDScript and C#. If you decide to work with it, here’s what to expect your workflow to look like:

1. **Create a new Go project**  
2. **Generate the binding code**  
3. **Write your C++ classes**  
4. **Compile the extension**  
5. **Load it in Godot**  

(Full step‑by‑step instructions, example code snippets and build configurations can be found in the official Godot documentation under “Getting started → GDExtension C++ example”.)
