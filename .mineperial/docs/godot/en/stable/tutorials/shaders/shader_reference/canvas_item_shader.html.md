# CanvasItem shaders

> **CanvasItem shaders** are used to draw all 2D elements in Godot. These include all nodes that inherit from `CanvasItem`, and all GUI elements. CanvasItem shaders contain fewer built‑in variables and functions than Spatial shaders, and are written in Godot’s shading language (a subset of GLSL).
