**Where to go from here**  
*Godot Engine (stable) documentation – XR*

---

When you’ve mastered the basics of XR in Godot, there are several directions you can explore to deepen your knowledge and build more sophisticated experiences.

### 1.  Advanced topics  
- **Physics & Interactions** – Learn about collision layers, physics layers, and how to create more realistic motion.
- **Networking** – Integrate multiplayer into your XR projects.
- **Shaders & Materials** – Use the new shader language to create custom visual effects.
- **Performance** – Optimize your scenes for large‑scale environments.

> 👉 For a complete list, see the *Advanced topics* section in the XR manual.

### 2.  XR demos  
Explore a collection of ready‑to‑run demos that illustrate many of the features discussed in the tutorials:

| Demo | Description | Link |
|------|-------------|------|
| **VR Adventure** | A simple 3‑D exploration game | [Download](https://godotengine.org/demos/vr_adventure.zip) |
| **AR Photo Booth** | Capture and display 3‑D objects on a real surface | [Download](https://godotengine.org/demos/ar_photo_booth.zip) |
| **Mixed Reality Walkthrough** | Combine 3‑D assets with the real world | [Download](https://godotengine.org/demos/mr_walkthrough.zip) |

### 3.  OpenXR settings  
Fine‑tune how Godot interacts with the OpenXR runtime:

- **XR Settings** – Configure tracking, input, and display options.  
- **Device Profiles** – Add support for new HMDs and controllers.  
- **Pass‑Through & Camera** – Enable camera streaming for AR.

> Check the [OpenXR Settings page](../../tutorials/xr/openxr_settings.html) for detailed configuration steps.
