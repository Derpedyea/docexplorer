**Note:** The HTML snippet provided contains only the site’s navigation structure and does not include the actual tutorial content for *“Introducing XR tools”*. Since the main body of the page is missing, it’s not possible to produce a faithful Markdown conversion of the document. If you can provide the main content of the page (the sections, paragraphs, code examples, etc.), I’ll be happy to convert it to clean Markdown for you.
