**Note**: The supplied HTML snippet contains the full navigation and layout structure of the Godot documentation site, but it does **not** include the main article body for the *Using the theme editor* page. Consequently, it is not possible to produce a faithful Markdown conversion of the actual tutorial content from the snippet provided. If you have the full page source (the portion between the `<body>` tags that includes the article content), please supply it and I will gladly convert it for you.
