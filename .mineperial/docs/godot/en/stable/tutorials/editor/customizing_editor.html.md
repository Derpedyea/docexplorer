**Customizing the interface**

---

### Moving and resizing docks
- **Drag‑and‑drop** the dock’s title bar to reposition it anywhere in the editor.  
- Docks can be **docked** to a side, or left **floating** in a separate window.  
- To split a dock into two, hover over the right edge of the dock until the resize cursor appears, then drag left or right.  
- Hold **Shift** while dragging a dock to adjust only one dimension (width or height).  
- The editor will automatically remember the new layout for the current session.  

### Splitting the script or shader editor to its own window
1. Open a script or shader file in the editor.  
2. Right‑click the tab or the editor’s title bar.  
3. Select **“Open in New Window”**.  
4. The editor will appear as an independent window, which can be moved to another monitor.  
5. To bring it back into the main window, right‑click the tab again and choose **“Dock in Main Window”**.  

### Customizing editor layouts
- **Save Layout** – Go to **`Editor > Manage Editor Layouts > Save Layout…`**.  
  *Give the layout a meaningful name* (e.g., “2D Workflow”, “3D View”).  
- **Load Layout** – Select the layout from the same **Manage Editor Layouts** menu.  
- **Delete Layout** – Remove unused layouts from the menu.  
- You can create multiple profiles for different workflows (e.g., one for animation work, another for scripting).  

### Customizing editor settings
1. Open **`Project > Project Settings`** (or **`Editor > Editor Settings`** for global settings).  
2. Navigate to the **`Editor` → `Interface`** section.  
3. Adjust visual options such as *theme*, *font size*, *color scheme*, and *toolbar visibility*.  
4. In **`Editor → General`**, enable or disable features like *Auto‑save*, *Undo history depth*, and *Show advanced options*.  
5. Save the changes; they apply immediately to the current editor session and persist across restarts.  

These simple adjustments let you tailor Godot’s editor to fit your personal workflow, multi‑monitor setups, and preferred visual style.
