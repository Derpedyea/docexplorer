**Script Editor**

# Script Editor

## Introduction

Godot Engine’s script editor is a powerful and fully‑integrated text editor that streamlines the process of writing and debugging code written in GDScript (and other supported scripting languages). It includes features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, error checking, and an integrated debugger, all within the editor’s workflow.

## Features

* **Syntax highlighting** for GDScript, C#, and GDNative scripts.  
* **Auto‑completion** and **code hints** based on the current context.  
* **Error checking** and warnings are shown in real‑time.  
* **Debugging tools** – breakpoints, watches, and a call‑stack view.  
* **Inline documentation** and quick‑help tooltips.  
* **Search and replace** with regex support.  
* **Line numbers**, **code folding**, and **bookmark** functionality.  
* **External editor integration** for advanced editing workflows.  

## Usage

1. **Opening a script** – double‑click a script file in the FileSystem dock or attach a script to a node and press the *Attach Script* button.  
2. **Navigating the code** – use the *Go to Definition* (Shift‑Ctrl‑B), *Find in Files* (Ctrl‑Shift‑F), and *Go to Line* (Ctrl‑G) shortcuts.  
3. **Editing and debugging** – set breakpoints by clicking the gutter, run the project, and watch the debugger panel for stack traces.  
4. **External editor** – configure your preferred editor in **Editor Settings → Text Editor → External** and enable *Reload on external change* to keep the Godot editor in sync.
