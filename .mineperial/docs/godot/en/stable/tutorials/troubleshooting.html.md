# Troubleshooting

The following sections cover common problems encountered when using the Godot Engine and provide possible solutions.

## The editor runs slowly and uses all my CPU and GPU resources, making my computer noisy

*Explain why the editor might be using excessive resources and how to mitigate the issue.*

## The editor stutters and flickers on my variable refresh rate monitor (G‑Sync/FreeSync)

*Describe how to disable vertical sync, adjust the refresh‑rate setting, or change the rendering backend.*

## The editor or project takes a very long time to start

*List potential causes (large scenes, too many resources, slow storage, etc.) and how to diagnose and fix them.*

## The Godot editor appears frozen after clicking the system console

*Explain how to restore focus or close the console window.*

## The Godot editor’s macOS dock icon gets duplicated every time it is manually moved

*Describe the workaround involving the `-d` command‑line flag or removing the `–` from the app bundle name.*

## Some text such as “NO DC” appears in the top‑left corner of the Project Manager and editor window

*Explain that “NO DC” refers to “No Direct‑Connect” and how to resolve it.*

## A microphone or “refresh” icon appears in the bottom‑right corner of the Project Manager and editor window

*Detail the cause (audio driver or console issues) and how to hide the icon.*

## The editor or project appears overly sharp or blurry

*Cover issues related to DPI scaling, display resolution, and the `stretch_mode`/`stretch_aspect` project settings.*

## The editor or project appears to have washed out colors

*Discuss possible color‑profile mismatches and how to correct gamma or color‑space settings.*

## The editor/project freezes or displays glitched visuals after resuming the PC from suspend

*Show steps to refresh the graphics driver or disable power‑saving features.*

## The project works when run from the editor, but fails to load some files when running from an exported copy

*Explain that exported projects may have different resource paths or missing dependencies, and how to include them.*

## The project crashes frequently or instantly after opening it from the project manager

*List common reasons (corrupt project file, incompatible engine version, missing plugins) and troubleshooting steps.*
