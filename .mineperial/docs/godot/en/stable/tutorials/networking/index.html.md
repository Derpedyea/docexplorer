**Networking – Godot Engine (stable) Documentation**

This page serves as the index for the networking tutorials in the Godot Engine documentation.  
Below is a concise Markdown representation of the content.

## Overview

The networking section of the Godot documentation covers a wide range of topics related to both client‑side and server‑side networking in Godot, including:

- **High‑level multiplayer** – the built‑in networking API for creating multiplayer games.
- **Making HTTP requests** – using Godot’s HTTPRequest node to communicate with web services.
- **HTTP client class** – the lower‑level `HTTPClient` API for custom networking logic.
- **TLS/SSL certificates** – managing secure connections.
- **Using WebSockets** – real‑time, bidirectional communication over WebSockets.
- **WebRTC** – peer‑to‑peer networking for real‑time audio, video, or data transfer.

These tutorials are organized to help you get started from basic HTTP requests to advanced multiplayer and real‑time communication.
