# Platform‑specific

Godot supports both running the editor and exporting projects on several platforms.  
Usage of the engine is generally similar across platforms, but there are some platform‑specific considerations, such as input handling, build settings, and platform‑specific APIs.

## Overview

> **Key points to keep in mind when targeting a specific platform**

- **Editor** – How the Godot editor behaves on the platform (e.g. macOS dock icon quirks, Android build options).  
- **Export** – Required settings, SDKs, and file formats for each platform.  
- **Runtime** – Performance tips, platform‑specific input, and device features (e.g. vibration, gyroscope, web worker limits).
