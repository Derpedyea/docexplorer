# Troubleshooting physics issues

When working with a physics engine, you may encounter unexpected results. While many of these issues can be resolved through configuration, some of them are the result of engine bugs. For known issues, see the list below and the corresponding workarounds or bug reports.

### Known physics issues

* **Collision response inaccuracies** – The physics engine may produce non‑intuitive collision behaviour in some configurations.  
* **Missing collision shapes** – When using custom meshes or very thin objects, collision detection can fail.  
* **RigidBody sleep issues** – Bodies may not wake up correctly after sleeping if certain conditions are not met.  

(Workarounds, configuration tips, and links to bug reports are detailed in the full documentation.)
