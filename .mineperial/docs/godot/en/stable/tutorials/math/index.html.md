### What you'll learn

* **Vector math** – basic operations, dot & cross products, normalization, and practical use‑cases.
* **Advanced vector math** – matrices, quaternions, and transforming coordinates.
* **Matrices and transforms** – 2D/3D transforms, view and projection matrices, and how to combine them.
* **Interpolation** – linear, cubic, easing functions, and custom interpolation methods.
* **Beziers** – Bézier curves in 2D and 3D, curve construction, and rendering.
* **Curves and paths** – using Godot’s Curve2D/Curve3D, Path2D/Path3D nodes, and path following.
* **Random number generation** – uniform and normal distributions, seeding, and generating random vectors.
* **Advanced math** – a deeper dive into mathematical concepts used in game development (see sub‑tutorial).
