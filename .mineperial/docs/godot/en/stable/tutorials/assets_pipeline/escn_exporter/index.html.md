**NOTE:** The raw HTML you supplied contains only the site‑wide navigation and header information – the specific content of the “Blender ESCN exporter” page is not included in the snippet. Because of that, I’m unable to produce a faithful Markdown rendering of that page’s body text. If you can provide the missing `<body>` section that contains the actual article (the `<h1>` headings, paragraphs, code blocks, etc.), I’ll happily convert it to clean Markdown for you.
