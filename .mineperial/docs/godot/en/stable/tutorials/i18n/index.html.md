### Getting started with internationalization

1. **Plan your language support** – Decide which locales you need and how you will manage translations.  
2. **Use Godot’s translation system** – Store translations in `.po` files or Google Sheets and load them at runtime.  
3. **Apply locale codes** – Follow BCP‑47 language tags to correctly identify language and region.  
4. **Test with pseudolocalization** – Verify layout and formatting without real translations.
