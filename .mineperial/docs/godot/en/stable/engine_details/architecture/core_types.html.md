# Core types

Godot has a rich set of classes and templates that compose its core, and everything is built upon them. This reference will try to list them in order for their better understanding.

*Definitions:*  
- **Object** – The base class for everything that can be instantiated.  
- **Resource** – A data object that can be saved and reused.  
- **Node** – An element of the scene tree that can have a visual representation, physics, or logic.  
- **Variant** – The dynamic type capable of holding any core type value.

> **Next**: [Variant class](/en/stable/engine_details/architecture/variant_class.html)  
> **Previous**: [Common engine methods and macros](/en/stable/engine_details/architecture/common_engine_methods_and_macros.html)

*(The actual page contains a detailed list and description of core types such as `int`, `float`, `Vector2`, `Transform2D`, `Rect2`, `String`, `Dictionary`, `Array`, `Signal`, `PackedScene`, and many more. Each type is explained with its methods, properties, and usage examples.)*
