*Unfortunately the source snippet you provided does not contain the full body of the article—only the page header and navigation.  Without the main content it is not possible to produce a faithful Markdown conversion of the documentation.  If you can supply the remaining HTML (or the original reStructuredText source), I’ll gladly turn it into clean, well‑structured Markdown for you.*
