**Debugging and profiling**  
================================

This section contains pages that provide guidance if you’re looking at the engine code trying to find an underlying issue or an optimisation possibility.  It covers a range of topics such as:

* Using C++ profilers  
* Using sanitizers  
* (and other tools that help you understand and optimise Godot’s performance)
