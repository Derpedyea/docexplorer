# Compiling for visionOS

The instructions for building Godot for **visionOS** are currently identical to those for iOS.  
The only difference is that you need to replace every instance of

```bash
platform=ios
```

with

```bash
platform=visionos
```

in the SCons command line options.  

For the full iOS compilation instructions (which are the same), see the [Compiling for iOS](/en/stable/engine_details/development/compiling/compiling_for_ios.html) page.
