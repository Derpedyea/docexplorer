# CLion

CLion is a JetBrains IDE for C++ that’s free for individual, non‑commercial development.

**Importing the project**  
CLion can import a project’s compilation database file, commonly named `compile_commands.json`.

> *Note: The rest of the documentation on this page contains step‑by‑step instructions on how to configure Godot to work with CLion, how to generate the compilation database, and how to set up debugging. Refer to the official Godot documentation for detailed sections such as "Setting up the project", "Compiling with CMake", and "Using the debugger".*
