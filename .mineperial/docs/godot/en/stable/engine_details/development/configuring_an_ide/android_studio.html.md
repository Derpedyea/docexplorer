**Note**: The provided HTML snippet contains only the navigation structure of the Godot documentation site and does not include the main body of the “Android Studio” configuration page. Therefore, a complete conversion to Markdown cannot be performed based on this excerpt. If you can provide the actual content of the page (the sections that describe how to configure Android Studio for Godot), I would be happy to convert it into clean, well‑structured Markdown.
