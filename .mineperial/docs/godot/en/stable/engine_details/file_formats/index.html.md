# Godot file formats

The file format section of the Godot Engine documentation covers the structure and syntax of the various project‑wide file types used by the engine, such as GDScript source files, scenes, resources, and more.  Below is a concise Markdown rendition of the page structure and its key sub‑pages.

> **Note:** The original HTML page contains a comprehensive navigation tree that spans the entire documentation.  For brevity, only the parts directly relevant to *file formats* are reproduced here.  Full content can be accessed on the official Godot documentation site.

## 1. GDScript grammar

A quick reference to the syntax, keywords, and semantics of GDScript, the built‑in scripting language for Godot.  
> *See the official [GDScript grammar guide](gdscript_grammar.html) for detailed examples.*

## 2. TSCN file format

The text‑based scene format (`.tscn`) used by Godot to describe scenes and nodes.  
> *See the official [TSCN file format documentation](tscn_file_format.html).*

## 3. Resource file format

Description of Godot’s binary resource format (`.tres`, `.res`), how resources are serialized and referenced.  
> *See the official [Resource file format guide](resource_file_format.html).*

## 4. Import and export formats

Information about how external asset types (e.g. meshes, textures, audio) are imported, how import pipelines work, and what export formats are supported by the engine.  
> *See the official [Import & Export formats page](import_export_formats.html).*

## 5. Miscellaneous file formats

Other file types used by Godot, such as shader files (`.shader`), project settings (`project.godot`), and the editor’s configuration files.  
> *See the official [Miscellaneous file formats guide](misc_file_formats.html).*
