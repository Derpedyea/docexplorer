**TSCN file format** – Godot Engine documentation  
===================================================

The **TSCN** format is a *text scene* file format that stores a single Godot scene tree.  
Compared with binary SCN files, TSCN files are human‑readable, easy to edit, and
well suited for version control. This page explains the syntax, structure, and
conventions used by Godot when it reads or writes `.tscn` files.

---

## 1.  Overview

* **File extension:** `.tscn`  
* **Purpose:** Represent a node hierarchy (scene tree) in a text form.  
* **Usage:**  
  * Created automatically by the editor when you save a scene.  
  * Can be edited manually to tweak nodes, properties, or resources.  
  * Useful for small scenes, debugging, or as part of a version‑controlled asset pipeline.

---

## 2.  Basic structure

A TSCN file is a plain‑text file composed of *sections* separated by a line of
`[section]` headings. The main sections are:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `scene` | Root node and general scene settings |
| `node`  | Individual node definitions |
| `property` | Node properties |
| `resource` | Embedded resources (textures, scripts, etc.) |
| `subresource` | Sub‑resources referenced by a node or another resource |

Example (very small scene):

```text
[gd_scene load_steps=2 format=2]

[node name="Player" type="KinematicBody2D"]

[instance filename="res://Sprite.tscn" id=1]
```

---

## 3.  The `[gd_scene]` header

The first line always starts with `[gd_scene]` and contains two optional
keywords:

* `format` – version of the file format (currently `2`).
* `load_steps` – number of loading steps; used by the editor during import.

```text
[gd_scene load_steps=1 format=2]
```

---

## 4.  Node section

Each node is described with a `[node]` line that includes its name,
type, and optional parent index.

```text
[node name="Player" type="KinematicBody2D" parent=0 instance=1]
```

* **`name`** – Node name as seen in the scene tree.  
* **`type`** – The Godot class name.  
* **`parent`** – Index of the parent node (0 = root).  
* **`instance`** – For packed scenes or external instances.

Children are implicitly determined by the order of the node definitions.

---

## 5.  Properties

After a node definition, all of its properties are listed as:

```text
[property "position"]
Vector2(0, 0)
```

Properties are typed by the value that follows; common types include:

| Value | Type |
|-------|------|
| `true / false` | `bool` |
| `1`, `-3.14` | `int` / `float` |
| `Vector2(0, 0)` | `Vector2` |
| `Color(1, 1, 1, 1)` | `Color` |
| `res://path/to/texture.png` | `Texture2D` resource reference |
| `""` or `"some string"` | `String` |

If a property is a dictionary or an array, it is written with the usual Godot
resource syntax:

```text
[property "custom_meta"]
{ "foo": 1, "bar": "baz" }
```

---

## 6.  Resource sections

Resources that are not automatically loaded by the scene are stored in
`[resource]` blocks:

```text
[resource type="PackedScene" id=1]
[subresource type="Sprite" id=2]
```

Resources can be nested via `subresource` blocks, which allow complex
hierarchies (e.g., a material inside a mesh).

---

## 7.  Common pitfalls

* **Indentation is not significant.**  
  The parser treats newlines and spaces as separators, not as part of the
  structure.
* **Comments** are not officially supported.  
  Use `#` only for developer notes outside of property values.
* **File encoding** must be UTF‑8 without BOM for best compatibility.
* **Resource IDs** are autogenerated; you should not rely on a particular ID
  between editor saves.

---

## 8.  Example – a simple 2‑D sprite scene

```text
[gd_scene load_steps=2 format=2]

[node name="Sprite" type="Sprite2D"]
[resource type="SpriteFrames" id=1]
[subresource type="ImageTexture" id=2]
texture = @Int(1)
```

After loading, Godot interprets this as a `Sprite2D` node with a single
`SpriteFrames` resource, which itself references an `ImageTexture`.

---

## 9.  Editing TSCN files

* **Human readability** makes it easy to manually tweak properties.  
  For example, change `scale` from `Vector2(1, 1)` to `Vector2(2, 2)` to
  double the size.
* **Diffs in VCS**: Since the file is plain text, changes are trackable.
* **Avoid manual edits that break syntax** – use the editor for complex
  resources or nested subresources.

---

## 10.  Summary

* TSCN is a lightweight, editable scene format used by Godot.  
* Its syntax is line‑based with clearly marked sections.  
* Useful for quick prototyping, version control, and debugging.
