# Slider

**Abstract base class for sliders**  
Used to adjust a value.

### Inheritance

```
Slider
 └── Range< Control< CanvasItem< Node< Object > > > >
```

### Sub‑classes

- `HSlider` – Horizontal slider
- `VSlider` – Vertical slider

### Description

The `Slider` class provides a standard user‑interface component for selecting a value within a range. It inherits from `Range`, which manages the core numeric behavior, and ultimately from `Control`, `CanvasItem`, `Node`, and `Object`.  

> **Tip:** Use `HSlider` and `VSlider` in the editor to create horizontal or vertical sliders respectively. They expose the same API as `Slider`.
