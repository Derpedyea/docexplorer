### Description
The **LightmapGI** node is used to compute and store baked lightmaps for fast global illumination in Godot Engine. It allows you to pre‑compute lighting information that will be used during runtime, reducing the cost of dynamic lighting calculations.

> *Note:* The full API reference (methods, properties, signals, etc.) is available in the Godot class reference.
