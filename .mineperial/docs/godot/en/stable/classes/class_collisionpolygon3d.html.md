**Note:** The HTML snippet provided does not contain the actual content of the `CollisionPolygon3D` class documentation; it mainly lists the navigation structure of the Godot documentation site. Because of that, it is not possible to produce a faithful Markdown conversion of the class page from the given source. If you can provide the full HTML of the `CollisionPolygon3D` page itself, I can convert it into clean, well‑structured Markdown for you.
