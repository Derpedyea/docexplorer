**Description**

A group of `BaseButton`‑derived buttons that does not allow more than one button to be pressed simultaneously. It provides a convenient way to create radio‑style button behavior without having to manage the pressed state manually.  

*NOTE*: The full API reference includes methods and signals such as `add_button()`, `remove_button()`, `is_pressed()`, etc. For detailed information, refer to the official Godot documentation.
