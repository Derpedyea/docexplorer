**Note:** The provided HTML excerpt contains only the page header, navigation, and meta‑information for the *OccluderInstance3D* class, but it does not include the actual documentation body (methods, properties, etc.). Consequently, a complete Markdown conversion of the class reference cannot be generated from the supplied snippet. If you provide the full HTML content of the class page, I can convert it into a detailed Markdown document.
