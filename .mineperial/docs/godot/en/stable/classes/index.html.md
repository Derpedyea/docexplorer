**All classes**  
*Godot Engine (stable) documentation – class reference index*

## Overview

The “All classes” page is the central class reference of Godot.  
It lists every built‑in class (globals, nodes, resources, utilities, etc.) and provides links to the detailed documentation pages for each one.  
Below is a concise Markdown representation of the page structure, including the main class categories and the navigation hierarchy that appears on the site.

## Class Categories

| Category | Example Classes |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Globals** | `@GDScript`, `@GlobalScope` |
| **Nodes** | `Node`, `AcceptDialog`, `AimModifier3D`, `AnimatableBody2D`, `AnimatableBody3D`, `AnimatedSprite2D`, `AnimatedSprite3D`, `AnimationMixer`, `AnimationPlayer`, `AnimationTree`, … |
| **Resources** | (list continues – see full docs for details) |
| **Signals** | (built‑in signals for nodes) |
| **Utilities** | (various helper classes and enums) |

*(The full list contains over 200+ classes; refer to the official documentation for the complete reference.)*
