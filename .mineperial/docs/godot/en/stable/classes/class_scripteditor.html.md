# ScriptEditor

**Class**: `ScriptEditor`

**Inheritance**: `PanelContainer < Container < Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object`

**Description**  
The Godot editor’s script editor. This class manages the text editor interface used for editing GDScript, C#, and other script languages within the Godot Editor. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion, debugging integration, and script reloading.

> **Note**: This class is part of the editor’s internal API and is not intended for direct use in user projects.

## Overview

The `ScriptEditor` is responsible for:

- Displaying and editing script files.
- Providing an integrated debugging console and error/warning reporting.
- Managing script compilation and reloading.
- Interacting with the project system to load, save, and search scripts.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Syntax Highlighting** | Uses Godot’s language definition to color code GDScript, C#, and other supported languages. |
| **Auto‑Completion** | Provides code completion, parameter hints, and quick documentation tooltips. |
| **Error Reporting** | Shows parse errors, warnings, and runtime errors inline in the editor. |
| **Debug Integration** | Connects to the editor’s debugger to step through code, set breakpoints, and view stack traces. |
| **File Management** | Supports opening, creating, and saving script files from the editor’s FileSystem. |
| **Multiple Tabs** | Allows editing several scripts simultaneously in separate tabs. |

## Important Methods

The following methods are commonly used by editor extensions and for custom tooling:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `open_script(path: String)` | Loads a script file into the editor. |
| `save_current()` | Saves the currently active script. |
| `reload_script()` | Reloads the script from disk (useful after external edits). |
| `set_breakpoint(line: int)` | Toggles a breakpoint at the specified line. |
| `clear_breakpoints()` | Removes all breakpoints. |
| `compile_current()` | Compiles the script, returning any errors. |
| `get_current_text()` | Returns the full text of the active script. |

> **Tip**: The `ScriptEditor` is internally linked to the `ScriptEditorBase` which provides a more lightweight interface for script manipulation. See the `ScriptEditorBase` docs for additional helper functions.

## Signals

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `script_changed()` | Emitted when the current script’s contents change. |
| `file_opened(path: String)` | Emitted after a file is opened. |
| `file_saved(path: String)` | Emitted after a file is saved. |
| `error_detected(error: String, line: int)` | Emitted when a parsing or compilation error is detected. |

## Usage

Typical usage of the `ScriptEditor` is internal to the Godot editor; however, plugin developers can access it via:

```gdscript
var editor = get_editor_interface().get_script_editor()
# Open a script
editor.open_script("res://scripts/my_script.gd")
```

When building custom editor plugins, you can embed a `ScriptEditor` instance into your own UI using `ScriptEditor` as a `Control` node.
