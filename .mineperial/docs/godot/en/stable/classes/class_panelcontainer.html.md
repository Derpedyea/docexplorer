A **PanelContainer** is a UI control that keeps its child controls inside the area of a `StyleBox`. This means that any content added to the panel will be clipped to the visual borders defined by the style box, ensuring a neat and consistent layout. The container is commonly used to create panels, windows, or any boxed UI element where content should not overflow outside the designated area.
