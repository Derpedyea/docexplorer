## Before you start

Before diving into the engine, it helps to understand the basics that will make the rest of the documentation easier to navigate:

- **What Godot is** – a cross‑platform game engine that includes an editor, scripting languages (GDScript, C#, C++ via GDExtension), and a full set of tools for 2D/3D content creation.
- **Core concepts** – scenes, nodes, signals, and the scene‑tree.
- **Typical workflow** – create a project, build scenes, attach scripts, run and debug.

> _Tip:_ If you’re new to game development, the **Getting Started** section contains step‑by‑step tutorials and introductory materials that will walk you through your first project.
