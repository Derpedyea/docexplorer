# Finishing up

You’ve now got a working game loop, a player that moves and shoots, enemies that roam the screen, a HUD that keeps score, and a few extra touches to make everything feel polished. In this final section we’ll:

* Add a background that matches the theme of your game.  
* Hook up some sound effects so that each action feels satisfying.  
* Add a simple keyboard shortcut to restart the game.  
* Show you how to export the project so you can share it with friends or post it online.  

> **Tip** – All the assets referenced in this chapter (sprites, audio files, etc.) are part of the “assets” folder that comes with the tutorial project. If you’re building your own game, you can use any assets you like.

## Background

Adding a background is as simple as dropping a large `Sprite` node into the main scene and pointing it at an image that covers the game window.

1. **Create a new node**  
   * In the Scene panel, right‑click the `Main` node and choose **Add Child Node → Sprite2D**.  
   * Rename it `Background`.  

2. **Assign a texture**  
   * In the inspector, click **Load** next to **Texture**.  
   * Browse to `res://assets/background.png` (or any image you want).  

3. **Scale the sprite**  
   * If the image is larger than the window, you can set `Stretch Mode` to **Scale** and `Stretch Aspect` to **Keep**.  
   * Or just resize the sprite so that it covers the viewport.  

4. **Move the background under the player**  
   * Make sure the `Background` node is *first* in the scene tree, or set its **Z‑Index** to a negative value, so that it renders behind the player, enemies and HUD.

You can also experiment with a `ParallaxBackground` for a scrolling effect, but a static image is fine for this first 2D game.

## Sound effects

A little sound goes a long way in making a game feel alive. In this section we’ll add two sound effects:

* **Bullet fired** – plays every time the player shoots.  
* **Explosion** – plays when an enemy is destroyed.

### 1. Add audio nodes

* Inside the `Player` scene add an `AudioStreamPlayer2D` node named `FireAudio`.  
* Inside the `Enemy` scene add an `AudioStreamPlayer2D` node named `ExplodeAudio`.

Load the corresponding audio files:

```gdscript
# Player.gd (partial)
onready var fire_audio = $FireAudio
var fire_sound = preload("res://assets/sfx_bullet.wav")

# Enemy.gd (partial)
onready var explode_audio = $ExplodeAudio
var explode_sound = preload("res://assets/sfx_explosion.wav")
```

### 2. Play the sounds

```gdscript
# Player.gd – inside the _process loop or wherever you fire
func shoot():
    # … create a bullet …
    fire_audio.stream = fire_sound
    fire_audio.play()

# Enemy.gd – inside the function that kills the enemy
func die():
    explode_audio.stream = explode_sound
    explode_audio.play()
    queue_free()
```

> **Note** – Keep the audio files in a dedicated `assets` folder and use `preload()` for quick access. If you want to mix multiple sounds, you can create additional `AudioStreamPlayer2D` nodes or use `AudioStreamPlayer`.

### 3. Adjust volume

If a sound is too loud or too quiet, tweak its **Volume** property in the inspector or in code:

```gdscript
fire_audio.volume_db = -3   # 3 dB lower than the default
```

## Keyboard shortcut

To make testing easier, let’s add a shortcut that restarts the current level.  
The tutorial already uses the `ui_restart` action, but we’ll confirm it’s set up correctly.

1. **Add the action**  
   * Project → Project Settings → Input Map.  
   * Add a new action called `ui_restart`.  
   * Assign the **R** key to it.

2. **Modify the `Main.gd` script** (or wherever you handle input):

```gdscript
func _process(delta):
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_restart"):
        get_tree().reload_current_scene()
```

This will reload the current scene each time you press **R**, which is handy during development.

## Sharing the finished game with others

Once you’re happy with the final look and feel, you can export the project to run on a variety of platforms.  
The tutorial uses the **HTML5** export target for quick sharing, but you can also build a Windows or macOS executable.

### 1. Install export templates

If you haven’t already, download the export templates from **Project → Install Export Templates**.  
You’ll need these to export to most target platforms.

### 2. Create an export preset

1. Open **Project → Export**.  
2. Click **Add…** and choose **HTML5** (or another platform).  
3. Configure the settings (resolution, window title, etc.) as desired.  
4. Click **Export Project** and choose a folder to save the files.

### 3. Share the output

* For **HTML5** – you’ll get an `index.html` file and a `godot` folder.  
  * Upload the whole folder to a static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, itch.io, etc.).  
  * Anyone with a browser can play your game directly.

* For **Windows/macOS** – you’ll receive a `.exe` or `.app`.  
  * Zip the folder and send it or host it on a site.  
  * Users can run the game locally.

### 4. Test the exported build

Open the exported files in the target environment to make sure everything works:

* Audio plays correctly.  
* Restart key functions.  
* Background and HUD are positioned properly.

That’s it! You’ve turned a basic “Shooter” prototype into a polished little 2D game that you can share with friends or publish online. Feel free to add more features – extra enemy types, power‑ups, particle effects – and keep iterating. Happy coding!
