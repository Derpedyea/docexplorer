**Setting up the project**

> In this short first part of the tutorial we’ll set up and organize a brand‑new Godot project.

### 1. Launch Godot and create a new project

1. Open the **Godot Project Manager**.  
2. Click **New Project**.  
3. Pick a **Project Path** that exists on your machine.  
4. Give the project a name (e.g. `My2DGame`).  
5. Leave the *Template* as **Default** (2D) and hit **Create & Edit**.  

> At this point you only need a clean project folder and a working Godot editor.

### 2. Organising the project

A tidy folder layout makes it easier to keep assets, scenes and code under control. A minimal structure looks like this:

```
My2DGame/
├── assets/
│   ├── audio/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── images/
│   └── sprites/
├── scenes/
│   ├── main.tscn
│   ├── player.tscn
│   └── enemy.tscn
└── scripts/
    ├── player.gd
    └── enemy.gd
```

* **assets/** – raw media files that will be imported by Godot.  
* **scenes/** – all the `.tscn` files that define your game’s node trees.  
* **scripts/** – GDScript, C# or other scripts that add behaviour to nodes.  

You can create these folders directly in the Godot editor’s **FileSystem** dock or on your operating‑system file manager. Godot will automatically pick up any new folders.

### 3. Setting a main scene

In the **Project Settings → Run** section (or by using the **Project > Set Main Scene** menu) point the *Main Scene* to `res://scenes/main.tscn`.  
This file will be the entry point when you hit **Play** or export the project.

### 4. Next steps

Now that the project is ready and organised, move on to the next part of the series:

* **[Creating the player scene](/getting_started/first_2d_game/02.player_scene.html)** – Add the player node tree and sprite.

Feel free to explore the *Project Manager* and *Project Settings* further before diving into the actual game logic. Happy coding!
