**Heads up display**

This section explains how to add a simple Heads‑Up Display (HUD) to the game.  
It introduces the required nodes, the scripts that drive the UI, and how the HUD communicates with the main game logic.

---

## ScoreLabel

`ScoreLabel` is a `Label` node that shows the player’s current score.

```gdscript
# ScoreLabel.gd
extends Label

func set_score(score: int) -> void:
    text = str(score)
```

Attach this script to a `Label` node named **ScoreLabel** in the HUD scene.

---

## Message

`Message` displays game‑over or other status messages.  

```gdscript
# Message.gd
extends Label

func set_message(message: String) -> void:
    text = message
    show()
```

This node is hidden by default (`visible = false`) and is made visible when a message is set.

---

## StartButton

The start/restart button lets the player begin a new round.

```gdscript
# StartButton.gd
extends Button

signal start_pressed

func _ready() -> void:
    connect("pressed", self, "_on_pressed")

func _on_pressed() -> void:
    emit_signal("start_pressed")
```

Place a `Button` node named **StartButton** and attach this script. The button’s text can be set to “Start” or “Retry” as needed.

---

## Connecting HUD to Main

In the main game scene (`Main.tscn`) you instantiate the HUD and connect its signals to the main logic.

```gdscript
# Main.gd
var hud

func _ready() -> void:
    hud = get_node("HUD")
    hud.connect("start_pressed", self, "_on_start_pressed")
    # If using signals from other nodes (e.g., enemy died)
    # hud.connect("score_updated", self, "_on_score_updated")
```

The `start_pressed` signal is emitted when the start button is pressed, resetting the game state.

---

## Removing old creeps

When an enemy is defeated or leaves the play area, it should be removed from the scene.  
Add this to the enemy script or the main loop:

```gdscript
func _on_Enemy_body_exited(body):
    if body.is_in_group("player"):
        queue_free()
```

Alternatively, iterate over the children and free those that are no longer active.

**Note:**  
All scripts assume the HUD nodes are correctly named and placed in the scene tree. Adjust the paths if your structure differs.
