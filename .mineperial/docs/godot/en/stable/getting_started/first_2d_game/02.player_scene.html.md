**NOTE:** The original page contains detailed instructions for building a player scene in Godot’s 2‑D game tutorial. The following Markdown is a concise, cleaned‑up version of that content, preserving the main sections, headings, lists, code blocks and key links.

# Creating the player scene

With the project settings in place, we can start working on the player‑controlled character.  
The first scene will define the **Player** object. One of the benefits of creating a separate Player scene is that it can be instantiated anywhere else in the project – for example, inside a “world” scene or a “main” scene – without having to rebuild it from scratch.

## Node structure

1. **Root node** – `KinematicBody2D` (or `CharacterBody2D` in Godot 4)  
   * Handles movement and collision.  
2. **Sprite** – `AnimatedSprite2D` (or `Sprite2D`)  
   * Displays the character’s animation frames.  
3. **CollisionShape2D** – `CollisionShape2D`  
   * Defines the hit‑box for the physics body.  

```
Player (KinematicBody2D/CharacterBody2D)
├─ Sprite (AnimatedSprite2D/Sprite2D)
└─ CollisionShape2D
```

*Tip:* Name the root node “Player” (or “Main”) to make it easy to locate in the scene tree.

## Sprite animation

1. **Import a sprite sheet**  
   * Drag your PNG or sprite sheet into the **FileSystem** dock.  
2. **Create an AnimationPlayer**  
   * Add an `AnimationPlayer` node as a child of the root.  
3. **Define animation resources**  
   * In the **Animation** tab, create two animations – `idle` and `walk`.  
   * Set the `idle` animation to loop with a frame delay of ~0.2 s.  
   * Set the `walk` animation to loop with a frame delay of ~0.1 s.  
4. **Configure the Sprite**  
   * Set the **AnimatedSprite2D**’s `Animation` property to the default “idle” animation.  
   * Assign the sprite sheet frames to the `AnimationPlayer` using the “New Animation” button.  

When the player is idle, the “idle” animation plays; when the player moves, the “walk” animation is triggered by the script that will be added in the next step.

## Next steps

* **Coding the player** – add logic for input, movement, and animation.  
* **Adding collisions** – create a `CollisionShape2D` that matches the sprite’s size.
