**Character animation**

> *In this final lesson, we’ll use Godot’s built‑in animation tools to make our characters float and flap. You’ll learn to design animations in the editor and use code to make your game feel alive.*

## 1️⃣ Using the animation editor

1. **Create an `AnimationPlayer` node**  
   *Add an `AnimationPlayer` as a child of your player’s root node.*

2. **Open the animation dock**  
   *Click the **Animation** tab at the bottom of the editor.  
   Press **New** → give it a name, e.g. `float`.*

3. **Add a keyframe**  
   *Move the animation scrubber to a frame (e.g., 0).  
   Select the property you want to animate (e.g., `transform` → `translation`).  
   Click the “key” button.*

4. **Animate**  
   *Move the scrubber to another frame (e.g., 30), change the property value, and key it again.*  

5. **Fine‑tune**  
   *Use the curve editor to smooth transitions or create looping paths.*

## 2️⃣ The float animation

```gdscript
# Player.gd
extends CharacterBody3D

var anim_player : AnimationPlayer

func _ready() -> void:
    anim_player = $AnimationPlayer
    anim_player.play("float")
```

- **Looping** – In the animation editor set the **Loop** flag.
- **Blending** – If you have a “walk” animation, blend it with “float” for a smooth transition.

## 3️⃣ Animating the mobs

1. **Add an AnimationPlayer**  
   *Every mob scene gets its own `AnimationPlayer`.*

2. **Create a “flap” animation**  
   *Key the `Rotation` of the mob’s sprite/mesh to make it look like flapping.*

3. **Play via script**  

```gdscript
# Mob.gd
extends CharacterBody3D

var anim_player : AnimationPlayer

func _ready() -> void:
    anim_player = $AnimationPlayer
    anim_player.play("flap")
```

4. **Synchronise with movement**  
   *If the mob is moving, you can mix the “flap” animation with a “run” animation using an `AnimationTree`.*

> **Next steps** – You’re ready to add more nuanced animations (e.g., squashing, dying) in the “Going further” section.
