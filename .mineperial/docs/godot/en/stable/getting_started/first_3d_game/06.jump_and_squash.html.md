**Jumping and squashing monsters**  
*From the “Your first 3D game” tutorial series*

In this part we’ll add the ability for the player to jump and squash the monsters. In the next lesson we’ll make the player die when a monster hits them on the ground. First, we have to change a few settings in the project and the player script.
