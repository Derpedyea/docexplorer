**Score and Replay**

The following sections walk you through the final touches for the 3D game tutorial: setting up a UI theme, keeping track of the score, implementing a retry mechanism, and adding background music.

---

## 1. Creating a UI Theme
*(Details omitted – see the original documentation for full implementation.)*

### 1.1. Theme Overview
- Define custom styles for labels, buttons, and other UI elements.
- Load the theme into the HUD node.

### 1.2. Applying Theme Resources
- Use `Theme` resources in the editor or via code.
- Ensure consistency across all UI components.

---

## 2. Keeping Track of the Score
*(Details omitted – see the original documentation for full implementation.)*

### 2.1. Score Variable
- Store the current score in a global or scene-level variable.
- Update the score when a mob is killed or a point is earned.

### 2.2. Displaying the Score
- Update the label text each frame or on score change.
- Format the score for readability (e.g., leading zeros).

---

## 3. Retrying the Game
*(Details omitted – see the original documentation for full implementation.)*

### 3.1. Restart Button
- Add a “Retry” button to the HUD.
- Connect its `pressed` signal to a function that resets the game state.

### 3.2. Resetting Game State
- Reinitialize player position, score, and spawn counters.
- Clear any existing mobs or projectiles.

---

## 4. Adding Music
*(Details omitted – see the original documentation for full implementation.)*

### 4.1. AudioStreamPlayer
- Add an `AudioStreamPlayer` node to the main scene.
- Load a music track and set it to loop.

### 4.2. Control Playback
- Start the music when the game begins.
- Pause or stop the music on game over or exit.

### Full Code Examples

```gdscript
# Example: Updating the score label
func _on_Mob_killed():
    score += 1
    $HUD/ScoreLabel.text = str(score)

# Example: Restarting the game
func _on_RetryButton_pressed():
    get_tree().reload_current_scene()
```
