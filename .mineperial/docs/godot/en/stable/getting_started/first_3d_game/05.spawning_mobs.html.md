**Spawning monsters**

In this part of the tutorial you’ll learn how to make enemies (mobs) appear along a predefined path and then move randomly along it. By the end of the lesson you’ll have a basic “tower‑defense”‑style spawner that continuously feeds the player’s area with monsters.

## 1. Creating the spawn path

1. **Add a `Path3D` node** to the main scene (e.g. `Main.tscn`).  
2. In the Inspector, click the **Edit** button next to the *Path* property to open the *PathEditor* and draw a curve that the monsters will follow.  
3. Add a `PathFollow3D` child to the `Path3D` and set its *Offset* property to `0`.  
4. (Optional) Add a *MeshInstance3D* or *Spatial* node as a child of `PathFollow3D` to serve as a visual indicator of the spawn point.

## 2. Spawning monsters randomly

```gdscript
# Main.gd
extends Node3D

# Preload the mob scene.
@export var mob_scene: PackedScene
# Reference to the PathFollow3D node.
@onready var path_follow: PathFollow3D = $PathFollow3D

# Time between spawns (seconds).
var spawn_interval := 1.5
# Timer to trigger spawns.
var spawn_timer : Timer

func _ready() -> void:
    spawn_timer = Timer.new()
    spawn_timer.wait_time = spawn_interval
    spawn_timer.autostart = true
    spawn_timer.connect("timeout", Callable(self, "_spawn_mob"))
    add_child(spawn_timer)

func _spawn_mob() -> void:
    # Instance a new mob.
    var mob_instance = mob_scene.instantiate()
    # Position it at the start of the path.
    mob_instance.global_transform.origin = path_follow.global_transform.origin
    # Randomize the path offset to make mobs appear at different points.
    path_follow.progress_ratio = randf()
    add_child(mob_instance)
```

### Explanation

* **`mob_scene`** – the *Mob* scene you created in the previous chapter.  
* **`PathFollow3D`** – used to position each spawned mob along the path.  
* **`spawn_interval`** – how often a new monster appears.  
* **`spawn_timer`** – a `Timer` node that fires repeatedly to call `_spawn_mob()`.  
* **`randf()`** – returns a random float between 0 and 1, which we use to pick a random start point on the path.

### Testing the scene

1. Run `Main.tscn`.  
2. You should see mobs appear at random points along the path and start moving toward the end.  
3. Adjust `spawn_interval` or the path’s shape to experiment with different enemy waves.
