## Exploring the manual

The Godot Engine documentation is a rich resource for learning more about the engine and improving your game.  Take some time to explore the following sections:

* **Getting Started** – A quick tour of Godot’s interface, project setup, and key concepts.
* **Tutorials** – Step‑by‑step guides for 2D and 3D projects.
* **Best Practices** – Design patterns, scene organization, and performance tips.
* **Advanced Features** – Command‑line usage, custom editors, and engine compilation.

Feel free to revisit any of the earlier sections, experiment with new nodes, or dive into the class reference to discover advanced API features. Happy developing!
