## Tips for getting help

1. **Search first** – most questions are already answered on the forum or the `#gdscript` Discord channel.  
2. **Read the docs** – many common problems have an official documentation entry.  
3. **Include details** – provide the Godot version, OS, minimal reproduction code, and any error logs.  
4. **Use the right tag** – in forums, tag with *2D*, *3D*, *GDScript*, *C#*, etc., for better visibility.
