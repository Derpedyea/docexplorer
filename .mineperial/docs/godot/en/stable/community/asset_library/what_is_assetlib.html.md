# About the Asset Library

The **Godot Asset Library** (also referred to as **AssetLib**) is a centralized repository where the Godot community can share, discover, and download user‑submitted content for Godot projects.  
It contains a wide range of resources including:

- **Add‑ons** – reusable modules that extend the engine’s functionality.
- **Scripts** – ready‑to‑use GDScript, C#, or GDExtension snippets.
- **Tools** – editor plugins, custom inspectors, or helper utilities.
- **Other resources** – sprites, 3D models, shaders, and more.

The library is designed to be a one‑stop shop for developers looking to accelerate their projects by leveraging the work of others. All content is published under the license specified by its author, and the Asset Library provides a convenient interface for rating, reviewing, and downloading these assets.
